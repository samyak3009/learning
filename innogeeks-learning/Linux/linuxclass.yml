- Process and job 
  - Application/service --> It's a programme in computer like calculator.
  - Scripts --> a source code we can execute, it is written in a file or a file package which is executable SHELL Script/ bash Script.
  - Process --> when you run an applicatin a process get created for that application. it also geneerates a PID (Process ID).
  - Daemon --> Something runs in the background and execute a service until the service complete the work. Like Alarm Service.
  - Thread --> Every process can have one or moere thread associted with it. Like Service/Process --> Thread 1, Thread 2,.....
  - Job --> it runs a Service/Application or Process on the scheduled or a given time. Job Management -> cron job

  - top
  - top -u <username>
  - top + k <pid>
  - top + c for full path
  - kill <pid> 
  - kill -9 <pid> 

Application --> process ---> Thread1, Thread2, ...Thread10.
