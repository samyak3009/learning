- introduction to Nodejs
  - Nodejs is server side javascript run time environment. NodeJs is built on top of v8 engine and mainly used to create web server
  - Nodejs works in a single process threads, it provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent js code to block.
  - This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, 
    which could be a significant source of bugs.
  - Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side 
    code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.

- v8 javascript engine
  - v8 is the name of javascript engine which provide the run time environment to parse and execute the javascript code, 
    and this is used by the nodejs and chrome by which we are able to run and execute the javascript code.
  - v8 was choosen to be the engine that power Node.Js by which is gave an incredibal amount of power to javascript to write the server-side code also.
  - some other js engine are SpiderMonkey for FireFox and javascriptcore for safari and many more.
  - javascript is generally consider an interpreted language, but modern javascript engines no longer just interprete javascript but also compile it too
  - JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with just-in-time (JIT) compilation to speed up the execution.
