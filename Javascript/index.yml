    You don't have to get or download JavaScript.
    JavaScript is already running in your browser on your computer, on your tablet, and on your smart-phone.
    JavaScript is free to use for everyone.

    /*
    document.getElementById('myImage').src
    document.getElementById('myImage').innerHTML
    */

    In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
    
    /*
    <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
    </script>
    */

    Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

    /*
    document.getElementById("idname").innerHTML
    document.write("hello")
    window.alert("hi samyak")
    console.log()

    */

    In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object. This means that variables, properties, 
    and methods by default belong to the window object. This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional
